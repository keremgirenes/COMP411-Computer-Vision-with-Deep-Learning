    "Up until this point, we have worked with deep fully-connected networks, convolutional networks and recurrent networks using them to explore different optimization strategies and network architectures. Fully-connected networks are a good testbed for experimentation because they are very computationally efficient, on the other hand, most successful image processing methods use convolutional networks. However recent state-of-the-art results on computer vision realm are acquired using Attentional layers and Transformer architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will implement several layer types that are used in fully attentional networks. You will then use these layers to train an Attentional Image Classification network, specifically a smaller version of Vision Transformer (VIT) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The original paper can be accessed via the following link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf"
